r"""Gameplay tests: runs the built game in a test folder of its own (its own settings and saves, the play folder is not
touched), plays a scenario turn by turn through CV_PAD_LIVE (src/common/keyboard.cpp) and checks every step.

usage: python -I tools/cvtest/cvtest.py <scenario.json> [--build out/build/release] [--keep] [--judge[=<model>]]
                                        [--review=<model>|none] [--set <setting>=<value> ...]
                                        [--release eu]   the European release's executable (CastlevaniaEU)
       python -I tools/cvtest/cvtest.py --record <route> [--save <name>]    play, and keep it as routes/<route>.json
       python -I tools/cvtest/cvtest.py --make-route <telemetry.jsonl> <route>
       python -I tools/cvtest/cvtest.py --session <session.json> [--results <file>] [--keep]

A scenario is JSON:
  {"name": "...",
   "after": "<scenario>.json",            optional: that scenario's steps first (a path beside this one)
   "save": "<name>",                      optional: start from the saves a step kept with save_as
   "settings": {"display_mode": ...},     optional: castlevania.toml lines (windowed 960x540 by default, saved by this
                                          release: settings_version); a key set to null left out
   "env": {"CV_RUMBLE_TRACE": "1", ...},  optional: the game's environment besides (XBE_VIRTUAL_PAD=1: the presses go
                                          to a virtual controller the game reads through SDL, src/common/keyboard.cpp)
   "platforms": ["linux"],                optional: where it runs (windows, linux); elsewhere it is skipped
   "needs": ["textures"],                 optional: skipped without an HD texture pack in the textures folder the
                                          game finds (this repository's); "env:<VARIABLE>" without that folder named
                                          in the environment (CV_MOVIES, CV_TEXTURES, CV_VENDOR_DIR)
   "vendor": true,                        optional: AMD FSR's and NVIDIA's libraries copied beside the game from
                                          CV_VENDOR_DIR (its DLLs and streamline folder), as the launcher downloads them
   "dump": "<va>:<bytes>,...",            optional: guest memory saved after every command (game/live/mem-<n>-<va>.bin)
   "telemetry": <frames>,                 optional: the state every that many frames, game/telemetry.jsonl
   "perf": true,                          optional: the SDK's timings (XBE_PERF, a log line set each second): a
                                          step's own, those of the seconds it played, are its perf, in the report
   "shader_cache": "<name>",              optional: compiled shaders kept in out/test/shader-cache/<name> for the
                                          next run with that name (a run's own, so cold, when left out)
   "judge": "gpt-6-luna",                optional: every screenshot judged (judge.py; a step's "judge": false
                                          skips it, true is gpt-6-luna): screen.judge has scene, defect and hector,
                                          and a likely rendering defect or a scene the game state disagrees with is
                                          a warning. A Codex model takes some 4 s a shot; "jev-latest" well under
                                          one, but it is the weaker judge, so it only screens
   "review": "gpt-6-luna",                optional: with Jev, the Codex model that looks again at a shot Jev
                                          flags, its answers then the step's (the default; false for none)
   "steps": [step, ...]}
A step plays one of
  "press": "<entries>"                    keyboard.cpp's syntax, "0:a,500:b:300" or frames "0f:lsu:60f"
  "until": "<expression>"                 plays "poll" (default "30f:wait") again until the expression holds, at most
                                          "timeout" seconds (default 60); "poll_by": [["<expression>", "<entries>"],
                                          ...] plays the first whose expression held after the last poll instead
  "sweep": {"maps": [m, ...]}             warps to every room of those maps (all when left out), from the room
                                          table the game wrote (rooms.json), and keeps a screenshot of each; a room
                                          that fails does not stop the sweep. "rooms": ["m.r", ...] warps to those
                                          instead, "hold": <frames> stands that long in each after (with "perf",
                                          the room's timings); "skip_inactive": true presses Start while Hector is
                                          not in play, for a movie a warp lands in
  "route": "<route>"                      walks routes/<route>.json from its first room: the bot (src/common/bot.cpp)
                                          through each room's points, pressing where the recording pressed and
                                          playing its menus where it played them, out by the way the recording
                                          left; enemies within "guard" (default 600, 0 for none) are fought on the
                                          way and story scenes skipped; "box_shots": true keeps a screenshot of
                                          each box that came up on the way (<step>_box-<n>.png)
and may have
  "expect": ["<expression>", ...]         each must hold after the step
  "shot": "<name>"                        keeps the screenshot as <name>.png
  "save_as": "<name>"                     keeps the game's saves (hdd) for a later scenario's "save"
  "measure": {"<name>": [x0, y0, x1, y1]} the edge strength (sharpness) of those parts of the screenshot, as
                                          fractions of the window: screen.edges.<name>, the mean brightness step
                                          between neighbouring pixels (render scale and texture filtering move it)
  "luma": {"<name>": [x0, y0, x1, y1]}    the mean brightness (0 to 255) of those parts: screen.luma.<name>
  "tint": {"<name>": [x0, y0, x1, y1]}    how green those parts are, the mean of green less red's and blue's middle
                                          (-255 to 255): screen.tint.<name>
  "seams": {"<name>": [x0, y0, x1, y1]}   how far the strongest step between two columns there stands out of the
                                          median one: screen.seams.<name> (a straight seam, 70 and more; a continuous
                                          picture some 3)
  "differs": {"<name>": ["<shot>", x0, y0, x1, y1]}   the mean brightness difference (0 to 255) of those parts from
                                          the same parts of an earlier step's shot: screen.differs.<name> (the same
                                          picture 0)
  "click": "<control>" or [...]          clicks the in-game settings menu's controls first, by their names as it
                                          says where they are (CV_MENU_STATE, src/common/menu.cpp): made by the
                                          game as ImGui input (the live entry click=<control>), whatever window
                                          has the focus, a few frames apart; then the step's press plays
  "keys": "<key>[+<key>...]"              Linux: holds those keys (X11 names: F10, k, space, Left) while the step's
                                          press plays (the game reads the keyboard's state, which on Windows only a
                                          real key sets)
  "ask": {"question": "...",              asks a Codex model (judge.py, gpt-6-luna) about the screenshot:
          "choices": {"<name>": "...", ...}}   screen.ask.answer is the choice's name, screen.ask.why its reason
  "note": "..."                           shown in the report
Expressions are Python over the game state (src/common/telemetry.cpp) after the step: frame, map, room,
player.active, player.pos (x, y, z), player.yaw, player.hp, camera.heading, menu, modal, ...; prev is the state
before the step, screen has mean, std and flat (one colour) and, with a judge, judge.scene, judge.defect,
judge.hector and judge.by (the model; judge.first has Jev's answers a review replaced), step has fps, seconds and
saved (the game wrote a save during it), settings the run's settings (--set changes them), shots["<shot>"] the
screen of an earlier step with that shot (shots["a"].edges.floor < screen.edges.floor; its step's fps and seconds as
shots["a"].step.fps), log the game's log lines
of the step (any("Rumble" in l for l in log)) and runlog those of the run so far, found(lines, pattern) the
lines a regular expression matches and total(lines, pattern) the sum of its first group's numbers over them
(total(runlog, r"(\d+) shaders compiled")), saved the settings file as the game left it (saved.display_mode),
window the game window's size (window.w, window.h), menu_controls the names of the settings menu's controls as it
last drew them (a drop-down's choices while it is open: "aniso.4x" in menu_controls) and release "usa" or "eu". A
field the game did not report is None.

Each step also fails when the game exits, a command does not finish in time, or the log has a new error or guest
trap. On Linux CV_WAYLAND=1 plays on a headless Weston of the run's own instead of its X display (SDL's Wayland
video): the steps go by the game state and log, as there are no screenshots there. The report (report.md, results.json, a screenshot per step) goes to out/test/<scenario>-<time>/.

--session plays scenarios that come after the same one (a new game) in one game, that one once and each of the
others after it in turn, each from the courtyard where a new game starts Hector, with its own report (run_session;
suite.py makes the session files): {"name": "...", "release": "eu" or null, "parts": [{"name": "<test>",
"scenario": "<scenario.json>", "set": {"<setting>": <value>}}, ...]}.

--record starts the game as for play (the play folder's settings, keyboard and controllers; a fresh new game, or
the saves of --save) with its state recorded (CV_TELEMETRY, src/common/telemetry.cpp). Once the game is closed the
recording becomes a route, a leg per room as played, and the game's saves become saves/<route>.
