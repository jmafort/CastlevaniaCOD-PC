Castlevania: Curse of Darkness - native Linux port of the original Xbox version
https://github.com/jmafort/CastlevaniaCOD-PC (a fork of https://github.com/Pazzi7054/CastlevaniaCOD-PC)

This download contains no game: no game files, no disc image and no game code. You need your own
copy of Castlevania: Curse of Darkness for the original Xbox, the USA (NTSC-U) or the European
(PAL) release, as an .iso or its extracted files.

WHAT YOU NEED
  A 64-bit Linux with glibc 2.35 or later (Ubuntu 22.04 or later, Debian 12, Fedora, Arch,
  SteamOS and the like), on X11 or Wayland; graphics with a Vulkan driver (your distribution's
  Mesa drivers for AMD and Intel, or NVIDIA's own: NVIDIA GeForce 600 series, AMD Radeon HD 7700,
  Intel HD 4200, from 2012-2013 on, or newer); a processor with SSE4.2 (Intel from 2008, AMD from
  2011 on); about 0.6 GB of disk besides your game. Nothing else to install: Direct3D 12 on
  Vulkan (vkd3d) is in the lib folder, and the compiler the first start uses is in this folder.
  No internet connection is needed to play (the launcher looks for a newer release on GitHub
  when it opens; its Game page turns that off).

LINUX AND WINDOWS
  Windows has much better graphics support than Linux. Linux has been tested far less (in WSL
  only, never yet on a Linux PC's own graphics drivers), and some graphics are Windows' alone:
  Linux gets the port's fixes and its other features, but not the graphics extras that are hard
  to bring to it. Not on Linux:
    - ray tracing (traced ambient occlusion and lighting, reflections, characters' shadows, light
      shafts, NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction): Linux draws through vkd3d, which has no DirectX
      ray tracing
    - frame generation (AMD FSR 3 or NVIDIA DLSS)
    - shaders prepared ahead by the launcher: the game makes each as it first needs it, which
      can stutter the first time a room or an effect shows
  On Linux, but less tested: AMD FSR 3 and NVIDIA DLSS anti-aliasing and upscaling (DLSS needs
  NVIDIA's own driver, not yet tried on it), and HDR (not yet shown on a Linux desktop in HDR).

GETTING STARTED
  1. Extract this folder anywhere you can write to (your home folder is fine).
  2. Run ./Castlevania (or double-click it). The assets folder opens.
  3. Put your game in it: its disc image (.iso), or the extracted disc
     (default.xbe with its data, movie and sound folders).
  4. Run ./Castlevania again. The first start builds the game code from your copy, which
     takes a few minutes and shows its progress; then press Start. After that the game starts
     straight away.

A disc image can be the whole disc (a redump) or its game partition alone (an xiso), and a copy
whose header was patched for a hard disk loader or another region (title, media, region) is
fine: the game puts the original header back.

The European release plays too, in English, French, German, Spanish or Italian (the launcher's
Game page sets which). It has an executable of its own, CastlevaniaEU, which Castlevania starts
by itself when your copy is the European one: just run ./Castlevania as above.

./CastlevaniaLauncher has every setting (display, widescreen, render scale, controls) and checks
your game files. Its home page offers a newer release of the port when there is one: one click
puts the new program files in place, and your saves, settings and textures stay as they are.
In game, F10 or clicking both sticks in (L3 + R3) opens the settings. The launcher's language
(English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese or Russian) is chosen at the
bottom of its sidebar.

The field of view, the draw distance and the fog (Graphics), the HUD in the screen's corners in
widescreen, the PS2's stick response, the inverted camera and the rumble on both motors (Controls)
are by Calm-Consideration41.

Name a new game @CRAZY for Crazy mode or @TREVOR to play as Trevor Belmont; here these work
without beating the game first. The @ is on the last row of the name screen's letters.

HD TEXTURE PACKS (optional)
  Texture packs fans made for the PS2 game in PCSX2 work too: put the pack's replacement pictures
  (its .png or .dds files, folders inside are fine) in the textures folder beside Castlevania.
  The launcher's home page says whether it found a pack and turns it on or off; its Graphics page
  sets the largest size pictures load at (2048 by default; Full needs a lot of video memory).
  Packs, their makers' own work (not included here):

Saves are in hdd/E/UDATA/4b4e002d. Logs, including logs/compile.log from the first start, are in logs.

The compiler folder holds what builds the game code on your PC: the recompiler, and Clang and
LLD from the LLVM project (see compiler/LLVM-LICENSE.txt). It is used again only if the game code
has to be built again (a new release); the page that says the game is ready can delete it. The
lib folder holds vkd3d, which draws the game's Direct3D 12 with Vulkan (LGPL 2.1, see
THIRD_PARTY.txt); the fonts folder the launcher's fonts.
