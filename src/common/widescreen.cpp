// Widescreen, and the frame pass's overscan, through a renderer extension.
//
// Widescreen: on a 16:9 output the console frame is shown 16:9, and every draw into the back buffer is squeezed to
// 3/4 of its width around the centre, so nothing is stretched (16:10, widescreen_aspect: shown 16:10, squeezed to 5/6). The game projects with a PS2 style view screen matrix
// (c68..c71, or c85..c88 with the world matrix in it) into PS2 screen space, which c94 and c95 then scale to console
// pixels. Squeezing a projected draw is the same as narrowing the camera's focal length, so the 3D view shows more
// at the sides (Hor+). 2D draws (HUD, menus, text, backdrops, movies) keep their 4:3 shape in the middle, a movie's
// frame drawn larger about it as movie_view says (movies.cpp). Draws over
// the whole width that are no picture of their own stay whole: fades and tints, panels whose texture does not change
// across them (a message's dimmed panel), and passes that draw the frame itself back (which already holds the
// squeezed scene).
//
// Backdrops: the menus, the map and the save and load screens draw theirs in pieces, none over the whole width. The
// pieces at the frame's left and right edges have those edges pulled out to the screen's, so the backdrop reaches
// the sides, its outer pieces that much wider. Only for a backdrop of its own, drawn before the 3D world and any 4:3
// picture of the frame: the world's effects touch the edges too, and the title's logo is in pieces at the edges over
// its castle. And for a window over the world while one is up (ModalUp: naming an Innocent Devil), before the HUD:
// drawn over the 3D world as six pieces each half the frame wide, its dark edges stood as a 4:3 box in the middle of
// the screen. A tip is one picture over the whole frame instead, its words in it: it goes to the sides as kSides do,
// its middle as it was and its edges' black reaching the screen's: its texture read clamped past them (Clamp), as
// wrapped (the program makes its coordinates, so the renderer cannot tell they stay in it) its far side showed at
// each edge, the "Tip" heading again at the right.
//
// HUD at the edges (hud_edges): the HUD's draws, from the first of the frame that takes one of its textures (kHud: the
// sheet of the health bar's frame, digits and icons, the bar's fill, the icon at the bottom left) to the frame pass, go
// to the screen's left or right edge, rather than the 4:3 middle's: as on a 4:3 screen, the same way from the screen's
// corner. They go by the piece of the HUD they are part of, the draws that touch one another (the health bar's frame,
// its fill, its digits that reach past the middle of the frame; a message's box at the bottom right and its text),
// taken from the frame before: a piece at least twice as far from one side of the frame as from the other goes to
// that side's screen edge, one about the middle stays, and so does one with none of the HUD's textures. Before the
// HUD in the frame are the world's 2D effects (glows, sparks), drawn at the points they light, which stay; so does any
// 2D draw placed at a point of the world (its vertices carry the point's depth, w, where the HUD's have 1), whatever
// its texture: the lock-on marker is drawn from the HUD's sheet over the enemy locked on, and went to the screen's edge
// with the HUD once the enemy was off the middle. Nothing moves while the pause menu is up, or in a story scene. While
// a window is up (ModalUp) the HUD stays at the edges: it went back to the 4:3 middle, over the window, as one came
// up. The window's own draws after it (from its dimmed panel or its page on) stay on the window.
//
// The pause menu across the screen (menu_spread): its pages are a left column (Hector's stats, a list), a middle one
// (the page buttons and their cursor) and a right one (status, equipment), all in the 4:3 middle, under a title bar
// across the page. Taken from the frame before, its draws are gathered into groups (MenuGroups): draws of the same
// texture that touch (a word's letters, a list's rows) or share a row close by (a row of figures, of icons and their
// counts), and a draw onto the one drawn before it that it covers most (the cursor on its button, a title on its bar,
// not the figures the cursor also lies over). A group whose middle lies in the left 45% of the frame goes left, one in
// the right 45% goes right, the rest stays; each side by one amount, the most its groups all have room for, up to 70%
// of the screen's extra width, so a column keeps its own alignment. A group half the frame wide or more is a strip, the
// title bar: its vertices move as far as their side's column, those in the middle tenth by as far as they lie across,
// so its tiles stay joined as it stretches. The backdrop stays: its edge pieces reach the screen's sides as before, and
// its large pieces that join them stay put. Only the stat pages (Hector's, each Innocent Devil's) spread: a sub-menu
// (Item, Equip, Skill, Tips, Options, Summon) is built on panels across the page, a description's at the bottom, a
// list's frame, with text on them that a stretch would pull apart, and stays as the game draws it.
//
// Skies past the fog: the game builds its skies from painted strips, a moon and clouds placed far out in the world,
// past a room's far plane where its fog has hidden everything (the rampart of 5.7: a ring of sky strips up to 62000
// out, the moon at 45000, with fog from 14000 to 39000 and the far plane at 39000). With the fog and the far plane
// pushed out (game/view.cpp) they show as the PS2 shows them so: their pictures scrolled by their programs and
// wrapped (the SDK's TexcoordsAsGiven; clamped, they smeared into streaks and hard-edged blocks). Backdrop, off unless
// CV_BACKDROPS=1, gives the draws of the textures in kSky the room's own fog back (the coefficients in c91, as the
// game set them) and holds back those wholly past the room's own far plane, for comparing. CV_BACKDROPS=1 with
// CV_SKY_TRACE logs each room's candidates, the textures drawn only past its far plane; CV_SKY_HIDE hides them.
// The skies have glow cards too (kSkyCards), drawn additively out where the game's own view never shows them: with the
// view pushed out their edges showed as faint squares over the moon and the clouds, so then they are not drawn
// (SkyCard). Their programs place them by constants of their own, so their depth is not measured.
//
// Overscan: the last pass of each frame draws a copy of the frame back over it with rows -16 to 496 of the copy
// across rows 0 to 480, the PS2's 448 lines and their border shrunk into the NTSC frame; the European release's rows
// -16 to 490, and its columns -20 to 660 across the 640, the picture narrowed by 640/680. A TV's overscan hid the
// rows and columns at the edges, which read past the copy and smear its first and last ones into streaks, and the
// copy's first row and column, which the game's 2D draws leave out (on the PS2's grid, a pixel right and down: a fade
// misses them). The pass is drawn where its texels are instead, the copy's pixel at the frame's a pixel up and left of
// it, so the copy fills the frame pixel for pixel, as square as the scene was drawn. A movie's frame is not placed so:
// it is drawn as movie_view says (movies.cpp).
